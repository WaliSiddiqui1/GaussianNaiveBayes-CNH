The dataset used in this evaluation is a heart disease dataset, which contains various clinical and diagnostic features used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. It consists of both continuous and categorical attributes that are essential for medical decision-making. The information on this dataset and testing came from "Machine-Learning-Based Prediction Models of Coronary Heart Disease Using Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest Algorithms," which used the Cleveland Database from the UCI Repository. Both models rely on the assumption that continuous features are distributed according to a Gaussian (normal) distribution
